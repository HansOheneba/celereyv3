        Celerey is a personal finance and advisory platform helping you turn
        income into strategy with smart tools and guided advisory sessions. You
        can explore tools for budgeting and savings, and you can also book a
        session for more tailored support.

          Explore tools (Budget Planner, Money Manager, Savings Goals
          Calculator).
        </li>
        <li>Create your profile during onboarding.</li>
        <li>
          If you’re booking a session, complete payment and then choose an
          available slot.

  },
  {
    category: "Advisory",
    q: "What happens after I book an advisory session?",
    a: (
      <>
        After payment is confirmed, you’ll be taken to onboarding to complete a
        few details. Then you’ll select a session time. You’ll receive
        confirmation and any next steps needed to prepare.
      </>

  {
    category: "Payments",
    q: "How do payments work?",
    a: (
      <>
        Payments are processed securely. After checkout, Celerey confirms the
        payment and automatically unlocks onboarding and session booking. If
        confirmation takes a moment, the page will keep checking until it
        updates.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    category: "Payments",
    q: "My payment is taking long to confirm — what should I do?",
    a: (
      <>
        First, refresh the page once and give it a moment. If you were charged
        but the status still doesn’t update, contact support and share the
        email/phone used during checkout so we can verify quickly.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    category: "Payments",
    q: "Can I get a receipt or proof of payment?",
    a: (
      <>
        Yes. You’ll receive confirmation from the payment provider, and Celerey
        can also confirm your payment status if you contact support.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    category: "Tools",
    q: "Are the tools free to use?",
    a: (
      <>
        Many tools can be explored directly. Some experiences (like booking
        advisory sessions) may require payment. If something is paid, you’ll see
        that clearly before checkout.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    category: "Account",
    q: "Do I need an account to use Celerey?",
    a: (
      <>
        You can browse and explore, but for personalized experiences like
        onboarding, saving progress, or booking a session, you’ll need to
        complete the account/profile flow.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    category: "Account",
    q: "Can I update my details after onboarding?",
    a: (
      <>
        Yes. You can update key profile details anytime. If you need help
        changing something sensitive, support can assist.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    category: "Security & Privacy",
    q: "How does Celerey protect my information?",
    a: (
      <>
        Celerey is designed to keep your data protected with secure handling of
        sensitive information and encrypted transport. Access to payment
        confirmation is handled through the payment provider’s secure flow.
      </>

        No. Card details are handled by the payment provider. Celerey only
        receives confirmation details needed to unlock access.
